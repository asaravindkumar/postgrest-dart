# Postgrest Dart

Dart client for [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org). The goal of this library is to make an "ORM-like" restful interface.

Pre-release verion! This repo is still under heavy development and the documentation is evolving. You're welcome to try it, but expect some breaking changes.

## Using

The usage should be the same as postgrest-js except:

- You need to call `end()` to finish your query chain.
- `is_` and `in_` filter methods are prefixed with `_` sign to avoid collisions with reserved keywords.

You can find detail documentation from [here](https://supabase.io/docs/about).

#### Reading your data

```dart
import 'package:postgrest/postgrest.dart';

var url = 'https://example.com/postgrest/endpoint';
var client = PostgrestClient(url);
var response = await client.from('users').select().end();
```

#### Insert records

```dart
import 'package:postgrest/postgrest.dart';

var url = 'https://example.com/postgrest/endpoint';
var client = PostgrestClient(url);
var response = await client.from('users')
      .insert([
        { 'username': 'supabot', 'status': 'ONLINE'}
      ])
      .end();
```

#### Update a record

```dart
import 'package:postgrest/postgrest.dart';

var url = 'https://example.com/postgrest/endpoint';
var client = PostgrestClient(url);
var response = await client.from('users')
      .update({ 'status': 'OFFLINE' })
      .eq('username', 'dragarcia')
      .end();
```
